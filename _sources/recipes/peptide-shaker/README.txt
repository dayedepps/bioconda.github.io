PeptideShaker is a search engine independent platform for interpretation of proteomics identification results from multiple search engines,
currently supporting X!Tandem, MS-GF+, MS Amanda, OMSSA, MyriMatch, Comet, Tide, Mascot, Andromeda and mzIdentML.
By combining the results from multiple search engines, while re-calculating PTM localization scores and redoing the protein inference,
PeptideShaker attempts to give you the best possible understanding of your proteomics data!

Installation
------------

.. highlight: bash

With an activated Bioconda channel (see :ref:`setup`), install with::

   conda install peptide-shaker

and update with::

   conda update peptide-shaker

Notes
-----

PeptideShaker is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default
"-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
set globally this will take precedence.
For example run it with "peptide-shaker -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
