Notes
-----

The Spectacle github repo weighs in at around 500MB, a large portion of which is data files. These have been removed from the conda recipe, but a script (download_spectacle_data.sh) has been included here which will download those files from github.  In addition, a wrapper script `Spectacle.sh` has been included in this recipe and should be used when calling the program.
