Notes
-----

SearchGUI is Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script.
This shell wrapper is called "opsin" and is on $PATH by default. By default
"-Xms512m -Xmx1g" is set in the wrapper. If you want to overwrite it you can
specify these values directly after your binaries. If you have _JAVA_OPTIONS
set globally this will take precedence.
For example run it with "searchgui -Xms512m -Xmx1g"
