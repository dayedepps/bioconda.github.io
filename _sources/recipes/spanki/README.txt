Spanki is a set of tools to facilitate analysis of alternative splicing from RNA-Seq data. Spanki compiles quantitative and qualitative information about junction alignments from input BAM files, and analyzes junction-level splicing along with pairwise-defined splicing events. A simulator is also included to evaluate junction detection performance.
